Project Title: Battery Health Analysis

Objective:
To analyze the health degradation of a battery over multiple charge-discharge cycles using a given dataset. This analysis will involve visualizing key battery parameters such as Battery Impedance and Charge Transfer Resistance.

Data:
The dataset provided contains information about various battery parameters, including:

Cycle Number: Represents the number of charge-discharge cycles.
Battery Impedance (Re): A measure of the internal resistance of the battery.
Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct): A measure of the resistance to charge transfer within the battery.


Analysis:
By analyzing the trends in the two plots, we can gain insights into the battery's health degradation over time:

Battery Impedance: As the number of cycles increases, the battery impedance typically increases. This indicates a decline in the battery's performance.

Charge Transfer Resistance: Similarly, the charge transfer resistance often increases with the number of cycles. A higher Rct can lead to reduced battery capacity and power
